# UFOs

## Challenge
The webpage originally provided a table that included UFO sightings based on date. We updated the webpage to include more filters to include city, state, country, and shape. We included these filters so we can provide a more in-depth analysis for UFO sightings. Now if we wanted a specific sighting all we need to do is fill out more of the filters. 

I feel that we did not need to include the shape filter, but I suppose to more filters the more narrowed down or results are.
